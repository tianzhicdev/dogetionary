ai illustration 
when we display definitions on the front end, at the top we add a "AI illustration" option. it is first just a button, if user cilck it, it becomes a picture generated by ai;
we neeed:
1. in python, we make a prompt to ask openai api 'completion' api to imagin a scene that would be best illustrate this words; then we use the ai described scene to generate a picture;
2. in db we need a new table called illustration it should have (word, language) as primary key and they refer to word, learning_langaue in definitions table;
3. we should generate image and cache it in illustration table when users ask for ai illustration;
4. POST /generate-illustration and GET /illustration?word=? lang=? can be useful for frontend;
