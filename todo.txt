----
1. we should use datetime everywhere in frontend and backend; only when we display it we change it to date;


when the backend returns forgetting_curve, it should include the last review at 100% and make a dotted line between last review and the next review date. the next review date marker should always be at 25% of retention;
on the retention curve, on x-axis we only show creation date, today and next review date;



2. refactor the frontend and backend code -- use multiple files, one for each class, improve the reusability of the code, give every class a meaningful name, remove unused code;
3. we should refactor integration test so all endpoints are properly tested
4. we should create unit tests too so business logic heavy functions are tested too
