----
1. we should use datetime everywhere in frontend and backend; only when we display it we change it to date;


when the backend returns forgetting_curve, it should include the last review at 100% and make a dotted line between last review and the next review date. the next review date marker should always be at 25% of retention;

1. on the retention curve, on x-axis we only show creation date, today and next review date;
1. rewrite CLAUDE.md to reflect current codebase; keep the principles; 
2. the line between the last review to next review should be dotted, now it is a full line; if dotted line is not supported we can use a grey color;
3. remove "historical" "projection" in the legends
4. remove "learning timeline"
5. the review history should show creation time 
6. the decay rate and the threshold to set the next review date should be configurable at compile time, make them constants at the top for easy tuning; 


--- done ---

2. refactor the frontend and backend code -- use multiple files, one for each class, improve the reusability of the code, give every class a meaningful name, remove unused code;
3. we should refactor integration test so all endpoints are properly tested
4. we should create unit tests too so business logic heavy functions are tested too

5. add a feedback section in the settings tab -- with a submit button; users can write what ever they want < 500 chars then submit it; we should have a table user_id, feedback, created_at to collect feedback;
