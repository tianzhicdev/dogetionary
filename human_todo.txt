in the onboarding journey, if user is studying english, we add one more question
"are you studying for " menu with TOEFL/IELTS/NONE
we recommend the user to register but users can skip
if user select an active test, we should generate a schedule and display progress
"prepare for my test" on landing -> "practice"
display definition for new word in practice; perhaps with some special effects
"review" -> "practice"




let's design a teacher's portal
1. students can add an id in settings to join a group
2. teachers can access a web app /teacher-admin to view students stats
in /teacher-admin
we should all the groups
when click into a group, we show all the students and their stats
such as total saved words, total review count, 
when click into a student, we can see more details such as 
1. number of words saved in the last 7 days (show count for each day)
2. number of words reviewed in the last 7 days (show count for each day)
3. most recent saved 10 words 
4. more recent reviedwed 10 words
