in the onboarding journey, if user is studying english, we add one more question
"are you studying for " menu with TOEFL/IELTS/NONE

we recommend the user to register but users can skip
if user select an active test, we should generate a schedule and display progress
"prepare for my test" on landing -> "practice"
display definition for new word in practice; perhaps with some special effects
"review" -> "practice"



let's design a teacher's portal
1. students can add an id in settings to join a group
2. teachers can access a web app /teacher-admin to view students stats
in /teacher-admin
we should all the groups
when click into a group, we show all the students and their stats
such as total saved words, total review count, 
when click into a student, we can see more details such as 
1. number of words saved in the last 7 days (show count for each day)
2. number of words reviewed in the last 7 days (show count for each day)
3. most recent saved 10 words 
4. more recent reviedwed 10 words


we need to think about gamified app wholistically. 
target users: highly motivated individuals who want to take tests/ build vocabulary for work/ 
what is the best way to learn a language? 1. repetition and  2.use
strategically, we should make an app that focus on building vocabulary.
"<APP NAME>: vocabulary for ielts"

1. onboarding

optional: 
ask intention, nickname, age
registration

english level tests

essential:
ask days/commitment time;


2. Sections:

essential:

a. Progress & Lookup

c. Schedule

d. Settings

optional
e. leaderboard


tasks:

1. create landing page that shows progress and lookup option

2. generate schedule

assume X words need to be learned;
every day we add Y new words to be learned;

for each new word, we assume that they need to practiced at Z0, Z1, Z2... days;
get_schedule(past_schedule: [(datetime, true/false), (datetime, true/false)]): future_schedule [(datetime, true/false), (datetime, true/false)]
# this func should use existing get_next_review_date_new to calc 7 future review dates assuming that the user always get it right when reviewing the word in the future 

initiate_schedule(test_name, study_duration): {date: {new_words: [], practice: []}... date2:{} ... }
# here daily new words = (test total words)/study_duration
# we should exclude words that are not new from being added as new (exclude words from saved_words table)
# but the non-new words that are part of the test vocabulary should be added the schedule as practice words;

we need a database strucuture to store the schedule; 
we should be able to call initiate_schedule every day (or any time really) to refresh the schedule so we always take into account new events from the user, such as study_duration change, reviewed words that are supposed to be reviewed in the future (so the next review time should be delayed);
multi selections 

-- done --

1. the LLM calls need to be faster
2. some questions pronunciations are erroneous


1. progress bar 
2. when it is done, show badges for when 5, 10, 50, 100, 200.... ALL words learnt;
